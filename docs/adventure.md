# Go Adventuring

When you first register with our guild, you'll be given your very own map. You will use this map to keep track of which areas and dungeons you have discovered. You can view your map at any time with the `/adventure map` command.

There are two types of areas you can discover: Explorations and Dungeons. Initially, your map will only have the Farmlands Exploration area marked. You will have to discover additional areas on your own.

## Searching

You can search for new Exploration areas with the `/adventure search` command. The process of searching for a new area takes 1 hour. Because the realm is so large, there is a good chance you will come home empty handed.

## Exploration

You can explore an area you have discovered by using the `/adventure explore` command. This takes 2 hours.

When exploring an area, you might run in to a monster, discover treasure, or even find a new dungeon.

## Dungeons

You can delve into a dungeon you have discovered with the `/adventure dungeon` command. This takes 4 hours.

Dungeons typically have tougher monsters, but also offer better treasure.

## Rest

You may need to take a rest to recover from your adventures. We have a few different inns available, with the higher end inns costing more gold. The better your sleep, the more health and mana you recover.

There are no laws against sleeping on the street, if you find your coffers running empty. Our town is very safe, so while you might find your rest uncomfortable you will not be in any danger.
