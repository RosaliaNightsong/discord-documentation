# Contributing

Contributing to this project can be done in a number of ways.

## Issues

We track all of our current bugs, feature requests, and other plans on our [GitHub Issues board](https://github.com/RosaliaNightsong/discord-bot/issues). If you are looking for an opportunity to contribute, take a look at our open issues there.

## Data

Rosalia relies on a lot of data to power the RPG game. From monsters and dungeons to potions and equipment, everything is stored in the code base and readily available.

If you are creative, you are welcome to contribute new data for the game.

## Other Contributions

If you are not comfortable with working on the codebase, there are still other ways you can contribute! You can:

- Help test features
- Propose new features
- Keep this documentation up to date
- Create art for the various data
