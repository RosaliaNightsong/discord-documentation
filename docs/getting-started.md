# Getting Started

Rosalia Nightsong is a fun RPG game within a Discord bot! You'll be able to create a character, go on adventures, and get some loot!

> [!WARNING]
> The currently live version is a _beta_. Participation in the beta is very welcome, but existing data may be deleted when the version 1 release goes live.

## Create your Character

Use the `/character create` command to set up your character. Note that while you can only do this once, you can use `/character update` to change the descriptive information about your character.

## Go on an Adventure

Adventures come in two forms: explorable areas, and dungeons. Your character starts off with one adventure, the explorable area `Farmlands`.

You can explore that area with `/adventure explore farmlands`.

When you explore, you have a chance to unlock a new dungeon, encounter a monster, find a treasure, or come home with nothing.

Adventuring takes time, and you'll be unable to take another action for a while.

## Use your Items

With the `/inventory use <item>` command, you can use the treasures you've collected! These might be equipment, consumable items, or sellable junk.

## Have Fun

This bot is intended to be a fun game! If you have feedback on how we can make it better, or found something frustrating, [join our support server](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com) and let us know!
